I don't feel like documenting the whole thing rn...

## Rules:
Blah blah.

X Please credit the shader if you use it in your content.

X Distribution of the shader with any model is allowed

X Limit yourself from redistributing the shader(s) without undergoing any modifications.

X Commercial use is not exactly allowed. (As long as it is not used as a business or charged for it everything is fine.)
